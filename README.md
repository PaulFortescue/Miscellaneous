# Miscellaneous
This is a project based on Ha Thach's TinyUSB
It is only here to show my code, if anyone wants to use it feel free.
It does not work (certainly with Windows 11 Pro)
and fails with some kind of decriptor problem.
If you take MIDI out it's fine.
If you take CDC/MSD out it's also fine.
